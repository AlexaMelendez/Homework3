#The states with the highest cigarette price increases show a clear and steady drop in cigarette sales per capita from 1970 to 2018. In these states, higher prices led to faster declines in smoking. In contrast, the states with the lowest price increases had a slower and less consistent decrease in cigarette sales. Some of these states even show periods where smoking rates stayed flat or dropped only slightly. This comparison shows that raising cigarette prices is an effective way to reduce smoking, while small price changes do not have the same strong effect.
